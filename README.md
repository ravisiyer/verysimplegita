Small Next.js program that uses Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad Gita chapter summaries from a GraphQL endpoint: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphql (Explorer: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphiql), and displays it to user.

The article [Getting Started With Apollo Client in Next.js](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/next-js-getting-started) was very useful to write this small program.
