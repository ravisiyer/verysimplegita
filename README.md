This is a very simple but functional, open-source freeware, Bhagavad Gita web app. It uses Next.js and Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad Gita chapters and verses data from a GraphQL endpoint: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphql (Explorer: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphiql), and displays it on browser. It is shared under free-software MIT license.

The advantages of keeping this very simple are:

1. As plain HTML is used without any images, the content is automatically shown suitably for devices of various screen/window widths like PC or mobile without writing any media query and related CSS code.
2. As default margins are used without any header, navbar or footer, the text content fills up the available screen/window real estate of the device and shows maximum text content to the user.
3. The source code is very simple enabling developers to understand it quickly and use it as a starter or
   template to build more complex Gita web apps and other chapter-verse kind of web apps.
4. Software development students and learners would find it easy to study and use the code.

Of course, there are disadvantages too with the biggest perhaps being that the user interface functionality is minimal and does not have attractive frills like images and other graphics. I hope to work on another version of the app. which provides more user interface functionality.
