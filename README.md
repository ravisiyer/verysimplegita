Very simple Next.js open-source freeware web app that uses Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad Gita chapters and verses data from a GraphQL endpoint: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphql (Explorer: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphiql), and displays it on browser. It is shared under MIT license.

The advantages of keeping this as very simple are:

1. As plain HTML is used without any images, the content is shown suitably for devices of various screen/window
   widths like PC or mobile. If a user on a PC wants to view maximum content, he/she can do so easily by viewing the app in a full screen window. As default margins are used, the text content fills up the available screen/window real estate.
2. The source code is very simple enabling developers to understand it quickly and use it as a starter or
   template to build more complex web apps.
3. Software development students and learners would find it easy to study and use the code.

Of course, there are disadvantages too with the biggest perhaps being that the user interface functionality is minimal and does not have attractive frills like images and other graphics. I hope to work on another version of the app. which provides more user interface functionality.
